To whom it may concern,

I would like to apply for [position] at [company] which I heard about from University of Waterloo's JobMine.

[summary of my background that makes my backround sound relevant to the position]. As I understand, this internship [description of internship in my own words that makes my skills seem relevant]. Given my [super brief re-summary of experience] I am an ideal candidate for this job.

[I have heard your company is great to work for / the job description sounds perfect for me for x y z reasons]. [also maybe extra notes, for example if the position is in the US note that you're a CA or US citizen so it will be ok]

Sincerely,

Cameron McKinnon.
